## About ##
The Josua documentation provides detailed guidance for both researchers and operators, covering the implementation, customization, and management of the platform. It supports a secure and user-friendly data infrastructure, enabling flexible control for operators and efficient analysis for researchers.

## Documentation Overview for Josua Interfaces ##  

To support Data Custodians in implementing and customizing the Josua solution, we have created detailed User and Operator Interface documentation. These documents, provide the flexibility for continuous updates and adaptation to specific needs. Below is an overview of the key features:

### [User Interface Documentation](./User%20Interface/README.md) ###

Designed for researchers, the User Interface serves as a central workspace for securely analyzing sensitive data. The documentation includes:
* Navigation Structure: A guide to the layout, menus, and core functions, enabling researchers to easily perform their tasks.
* Interactions: Instructions on accessing datasets, executing analysis scripts, and handling security features, such as watermarked results.

This interface combines user-friendliness with strict data protection measures to ensure a smooth and secure research workflow.

### [Operator Interface Documentation](./Operator%20Interface/README.md) ###

The Operator Interface is tailored for operators responsible for managing and monitoring the Josua system. Key areas covered include:
* User and Role Management: Instructions for creating and managing user roles with customizable access permissions.
* System Configuration: Guidance on setting up the Josua components, integrating datasets, and configuring security measures.
* Monitoring and Logging: Tools to oversee system activity, data access, and overall platform performance.

This interface ensures full control over the platform while offering flexibility to meet individual requirements.

Both documentations are designed to support the sustainable use and further development of the Josua platform, empowering both researchers and operators to efficiently and securely manage sensitive data infrastructure.
